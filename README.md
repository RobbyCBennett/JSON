# JSON
*JavaScript Object Notation library for Rust*

I made this to learn about parsing a nested word language, also known as a visibly-pushdown language. This is a JSON library without any dependencies other than the standard library. It adheres to the JSON standard as described at [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
